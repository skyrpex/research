## Challenges

Really need a way to reference constructor/function arguments documentation
cloud.Table could have a nice API for defining columns rather than having to pass it all in the constructor
got confused by https://github.com/winglang/wing/issues/1550
I am able to cast things typed as "any" with a function, why not just add casting
